# Dates in R {#dates}

## Introduction

Working with dates and time can be very frustrating.  In general, work with the least cumbersome class. That means if your variable is *years*, store it as an integer; there's no reason to use a date or date-time class. If your variable does not involve time, use the `Date` class in R.

## Converting to `Date` class

 You can convert character data to `Date` class with `as.Date()`:

```{r}
dchar <- "2018-10-12"
ddate <- as.Date(dchar)
```

Note that the two appear the same, although the class is different:

```{r}
dchar
ddate
class(dchar)
class(ddate)
```

If the date is not in YYYY-MM-DD or YYYY/MM/DD form, you will need to specify the format to convert to `Date` class, using conversion specifications that begin with `%`, such as:

```{r}
as.Date("Thursday, January 6, 2005", format = "%A, %B %d, %Y")
```

For a list of the conversion specifications available in R, see `?strptime`.

The tidyverse **lubridate** makes it easy to convert dates that are not in standard format with `ymd()`, `ydm()`, `mdy()`, `myd()`, `dmy()`, and `dym()` (among many other useful date-time functions):

```{r}
lubridate::mdy("April 13, 1907")
```

Try `as.Date("April 13, 1907")` and you will see the benefit of using a **lubridate** function.

## Working with `Date` Class

It is well worth the effort to convert to `Date` class, because there's a lot you can do with dates in a `Date` class that you can't do if you store the dates as character data.

Number of days between dates:

```{r}
as.Date("2017-11-02") - as.Date("2017-01-01")
```

Compare dates:
```{r}
as.Date("2017-11-12") > as.Date("2017-3-3")
```

Note that `Sys.Date()` returns today's date as a `Date` class:

```{r}
Sys.Date()
class(Sys.Date())
```

R has functions to pull particular pieces of information from a date:

```{r}
today <- Sys.Date()
weekdays(today)
weekdays(today, abbreviate = TRUE)
months(today)
months(today, abbreviate = TRUE)
quarters(today)
```

The **lubridate** package provides additional functions to extract information from a date:

```{r}
today <- Sys.Date()
lubridate::year(today)
lubridate::yday(today)
lubridate::month(today)
lubridate::month(today, label = TRUE)
lubridate::mday(today)
lubridate::week(today)
lubridate::wday(today)
```

## Plotting with a `Date` class variable

Both base R graphics and **ggplot2** "know" how to work with a `Date` class variable, and label the axes properly:

### base R

```{r}
df <- read.csv("data/mortgage.csv")
df$DATE <- as.Date(df$DATE)
plot(df$DATE, df$X5.1.ARM, type = "l") # on the order of years
plot(df$DATE[1:30], df$X5.1.ARM[1:30], type = "l") # switch to months
```

Note the the change in x-axis labels in the second graph.

### ggplot2

```{r, message=FALSE}
# readr 
library(tidyverse)
```

Note that unlike base R`read.csv()`, `readr::read_csv()` automatically reads DATE in as a `Date` class since it's in YYYY-MM-DD format:

```{r}
df <- readr::read_csv("data/mortgage.csv")

g <- ggplot(df, aes(DATE, `30 YR FIXED`)) + 
  geom_line() + 
  theme_grey(14)

g

ggplot(df %>% filter(DATE < as.Date("2006-01-01")), 
       aes(DATE, `30 YR FIXED`)) + 
  geom_line() + 
  theme_grey(14)

```

Again, when the data is filtered, the x-axis labels switch from years to months.

#### Breaks, limits, labels

We can control the x-axis breaks, limits, and labels with `scale_x_date()`:


```{r, message = FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(lubridate)
g + scale_x_date(limits = c(ymd("2008-01-01"), ymd("2008-12-31"))) +
  ggtitle("limits = c(ymd(\"2008-01-01\"), ymd(\"2008-12-31\"))")

g + scale_x_date(date_breaks = "4 years") +
  ggtitle("scale_x_date(date_breaks = \"4 years\")")

g + scale_x_date(date_labels = "%Y-%m") +
  ggtitle("scale_x_date(date_labels = \"%Y-%m\")")
```

(Yes, even in the tidyverse we cannot completely escape the `%` conversion specification notation.  Remember `?strptime` for help.)

#### Annotations

We can use `geom_vline()` with `annotate()` to mark specific events in a time series:

```{r, warning=FALSE}
ggplot(df, aes(DATE, `30 YR FIXED`)) + 
  geom_line() +
  geom_vline(xintercept = ymd("2008-09-29"), color = "blue") +
  annotate("text", x = ymd("2008-09-29"), y = 3.75, 
           label = " Market crash\n 9/29/08", color = "blue", 
           hjust = 0) +
  scale_x_date(limits = c(ymd("2008-01-01"), ymd("2009-12-31")),
               date_breaks = "1 year", 
               date_labels = "%Y") + 
  theme_grey(16) +
  ggtitle("`geom_vline()` with `annotate()`")
```
