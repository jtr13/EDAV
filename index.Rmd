description: "This resource is a collaborative collection of resources designed to help students succeed in GR5702 Exploratory Data Analysis and Visualization, a course offered at Columbia University. While the course lectures and textbook focus on theoretical issues, this resource, in contrast, provides coding tips and examples to assist students as they create their own analyses and visualizations. It is our hope that students will contribute to edav.info and it will grow with the course."

## Everything you need for EDAV

This resource has everything you need and more to be successful with R, this EDAV course, and beyond. Let's get started!

With this resource, we try to give you a **curated collection of tools and references** that will make it easier to learn how to work with data in R. 

In addition, we include sections on **basic chart types/tools** so you can learn by doing.

There are also **several walkthroughs** where we work with data and discuss problems as well as some tips/tricks that will help you.

We hope this resource serves you well!

This resource is specifically tailored to the GR5702 Exploratory Data Analysis and Visualization course offered at [Columbia University](https://www.columbia.edu/){target="_blank"}. However, anyone interested in working with data in R will benefit from perusing these pages.
