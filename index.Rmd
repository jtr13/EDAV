description: "This resource is a collaborative collection of resources designed to help students succeed in GR5702 Exploratory Data Analysis and Visualization, a course offered at Columbia University. While the course lectures and textbook focus on theoretical issues, this resource, in contrast, provides coding tips and examples to assist students as they create their own analyses and visualizations. It is our hope that students will contribute to edav.info and it will grow with the course."

## Everything you need for EDAV

This resource has everything you need and more to be successful with R, this EDAV course, and beyond. Let's get started!

With this resource, we try to give you a **curated collection of tools and references** that will make it easier to learn how to work with data in R. 

In addition, we include sections on **basic chart types/tools** so you can learn by doing.

There are also **several walkthroughs** where we work with data and discuss problems as well as some tips/tricks that will help you.

We hope this resource serves you well!

This resource is specifically tailored to the GR5702 Exploratory Data Analysis and Visualization course offered at [Columbia University](https://www.columbia.edu/){target="_blank"}. However, anyone interested in working with data in R will benefit from perusing these pages.

## How this resource is structured

This resource is split into four color-coded sections, each of which provides different kinds of assistance. Below is an explanation of each section:

### Section I: Information (Blue)

![](images/banners/banner_blue.png)

Pages in the **blue section** contain basic **information**. Examples of blue pages include this introduction page and the [basics page](basics.html), which explains how to setup R/RStudio as well as ways to get help if you need it. Blue pages are the help desk of this resource: look to them if you are lost and need to find your way.

### Section II: Walkthroughs (Red)

![](images/banners/banner_red.png)

Pages in the **red section** contain more extensive **walkthroughs**. An example of a red page is the [iris walkthrough](iris.html), where a well-known dataset is presented as a pretty scatterplot and steps are shown from start to finish. This page type is the most thorough: it tries to provide full documentation, explanations of design choices, and advice on best practices. It's like going to office hours and having a great clarifying chat with a course assistant...in article form. If you would like to see a fully-worked-through example of something with a lot of guidance along the way, check out the red pages.

### Section III: Documentation (Green)

![](images/banners/banner_green.png)

Pages in the **green section** contain more compact **documentation**. An example of a green page is the [histogram page](histo.html), which includes simple examples of how to create histograms, when to use them, and things to be aware of/watch out for. The green pages hold your hand much less than the red pages: they explain how to use a chart/tool using examples and simple terms. If you have an idea in mind and are just wondering how to execute it, the green pages will help fill in those gaps.

### Section IV: References (Yellow)

![](images/banners/banner_yellow.png)

Pages in the **yellow section** contain simple collections of  **references**. An example of a yellow page is the [external resources page](general.html), which is a list of materials that you can look through and learn from. Yellow pages have the least amount of hand-holding: they are collections of resources and bare-boned tutorials that will help you learn about new things.
