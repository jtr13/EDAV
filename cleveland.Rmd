## Overview

This section covers how to make Cleveland dot plots. Cleveland dot plots are a great alternative to a simple bar chart, particularly if you have more than a few items. It doesn’t take much for a bar chart to look cluttered. In the same amount of space, many more values can be included in a dot plot, and it’s easier to read as well. R has a built-in base function, `dotchart()`, but since it’s such an easy graph to draw, doing it “from scratch” in *ggplot2* or base allows for more customization.


```{r ggdot, fig.height = 6, fig.width = 5, echo = FALSE, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE} 
library(tidyverse)
# create a theme for dot plots, which can be reused
theme_dotplot <- theme_bw(14) +
    theme(axis.text.y = element_text(size = rel(.75)),
    	axis.ticks.y = element_blank(),
        axis.title.x = element_text(size = rel(.75)),
        panel.grid.major.x = element_blank(),
        panel.grid.major.y = element_line(size = 0.5),
        panel.grid.minor.x = element_blank())
        
# move row names to a dataframe column        
df <-  swiss %>% tibble::rownames_to_column("Province")

# create the plot
ggplot(df, aes(x = Fertility, y = reorder(Province, Fertility))) +
	geom_point(color = "blue") +
	scale_x_continuous(limits = c(35, 95),
		breaks = seq(40, 90, 10)) +
	theme_dotplot +
	xlab("\nannual live births per 1,000 women aged 15-44") +
	ylab("French-speaking provinces\n") +
	ggtitle("Standardized Fertility Measure\nSwitzerland, 1888")
```

The code:

```{r ref.label='ggdot', eval=FALSE}
```

## Multiple dots

For this example we'll use 2010 data on SAT mean scores for a sample of New York City public schools:


```{r}
df <- read_csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jtr13/StatGraph5293/master/data/SAT2010.csv",
               na = "s")

set.seed(5293)
tidydf <- df %>%
  filter(!is.na(`Critical Reading Mean`)) %>%
  sample_n(20) %>%
  rename(Reading = "Critical Reading Mean", Math = "Mathematics Mean",
         Writing = "Writing Mean") %>%
  gather(key = "Test", value = "Mean", "Reading", "Math", "Writing")

ggplot(tidydf, aes(Mean, `School Name`, color = Test)) +
  geom_point() +
  ggtitle("Schools are sorted alphabetically", sub = "not the best option") + ylab("") +
  theme_dotplot
```


Note that `School Name` is sorted by factor level, which by default is alphabetical. A better choice is to sort by one of the levels of `Test`. It's usually best to try sorting on different factor levels and observe the patterns that appear.

To perform the double sort, that is, sorting `School Name` by `Test` *and then* `Mean`, we use `forcats::fct_reorder2()`. This function sorts `.f` (a factor or character vector) by two sorting vectors, `.x` and `.y`. For this type of plot, `.x` is the variable represented by the colored dots and `.y` is the continuous variable mapped to the y-axis. 

Suppose we wish to sort the schools by mean reading score. We can do this by limiting the `Test` variable to "Reading" when sorting on `Mean`:


```{r}
ggplot(tidydf, 
       aes(Mean, fct_reorder2(`School Name`, Test=="Reading", Mean, .desc = FALSE),
           color = Test)) +
  geom_point() + ggtitle("Schools sorted by Reading mean") + ylab("") +
  theme_dotplot 
```

(Thanks to ___ ___ for suggesting this simple method, which does not require the reordering of factor levels.)

While this is the go-to method, there may be cases in which it's easier to specify that you wish to sort by the first or the last factor level of the first sorting variable (`Test`), without spelling it out. 

If a factor level is not specified, `fct_reorder2()` by default will sort on the *last* factor level of `.x`. In this case, "Writing" is the last factor level of `Test`:

```{r}
ggplot(tidydf, 
       aes(Mean, fct_reorder2(`School Name`, Test, Mean, .desc = FALSE),
           color = Test)) +
  geom_point() + ggtitle("Schools sorted by Writing mean") + ylab("") +
  theme_dotplot
```

If you desire to sort by the *first* factor level of `.x`, "Math" in this case, you'll need the development version of **forcats**, which you can install with:

`devtools::install_github("tidyverse/forcats")`

Change the default sorting function, `last2()`, to `first2()`:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
ggplot(tidydf, 
       aes(Mean, fct_reorder2(`School Name`, Test, Mean, .fun = first2, .desc = FALSE),
           color = Test)) +
  geom_point() + ggtitle("Schools sorted by Math mean") + ylab("") +
  theme_dotplot
```
