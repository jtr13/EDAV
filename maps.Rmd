## Choropleth maps

Cloropleth maps use color to indicate the value of a variable within a defined region, generally political boundaries.  The **choroplethr** package makes it simple to draw choropleth maps of [U.S. states, countries, and census tracts, as well as countries of the world](https://arilamstein.com/documentation/choroplethr/reference/){target="_blank"}; **choroplethrZip** provides data for [zip code level choropleths](https://arilamstein.com/creating-zip-code-choropleths-choroplethrzip/){target="_blank"}; **choroplethrAdmin1** draws choropleths for administrative regions of [world countries](https://rdrr.io/cran/choroplethrAdmin1/man/get_admin1_countries.html){target="_blank"}.

Note: You must install also install **choroplethrMaps** for **choroplethr** to work.  In addition, **choroplethr** requires a number of other dependencies which should be installed automatically, but if they aren't, you can manually install the missing packages that you are notified about when you call `library(choroplethr)`: **maptools**, and **rgdal**, **sp**.


We'll use the `state.x77` dataset for this example:

```{r, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(choroplethr)

# data frame must contain "region" and "value" columns

df_illiteracy <- state.x77 %>% as.data.frame() %>% 
  rownames_to_column("state") %>% 
  transmute(region = tolower(`state`), value = Illiteracy)

state_choropleth(df_illiteracy,
                 title = "State Illiteracy Rates, 1977",
                 legend = "Percent Illiterate")
```

**Note**: the `choroplethr` "free course" that you may come across arrives one lesson at a time by email over an extended period so not the best option unless you have a few weeks to spare.

## Square bins

Packages such as `statebins` create choropleth style maps with equal size regions that roughly represent the location of the region, but not the size or shape.

**Important**:  Don't install `statebins` from CRAN; use the [dev version](https://github.com/hrbrmstr/statebins){target="_blank"} -- it contains many improvements, which are detailed in ["Statebins Reimagined"](https://rud.is/b/2017/11/18/statebins-reimagined/#comment-19346){target="_blank"}.

```{r}
# devtools::install_github("hrbrmstr/statebins")
library(statebins)
df_illit <- state.x77 %>% as.data.frame() %>% 
  rownames_to_column("state") %>% 
  select(state, Illiteracy)

# Note: direction = 1 switches the order of the fill scale 
# so darker shades represent higher illiteracy rates
# (The default is -1).

statebins(df_illit, value_col="Illiteracy",
          name = "%", direction = 1) +
  ggtitle("State Illiteracy Rates, 1977") +
  theme_statebins()
```

## Longitude / Latitude data 

Note that the options above work with *political boundaries*, based on the names of the regions that you provide. If you have longitude / latitude data, **ggmap** is a good choice.  It is straight-forward to plot lon/lat data on a Cartestian coordinate system, with the x-axis representation longitude and the y-axis latitude -- just be careful not to mix them up. The **ggmap** package provides a variety of maps that can serve as the backdrop for the long/lat points. 

**ggmap** offers a number of different map sources.  Google Maps API was the go-to, but they now [require you to enable billing through Google Cloud Platorm](https://cloud.google.com/free/){target="_blank"}.  You get $300 in free credit, but if providing a credit card isn't your thing, you may consider using Stamen Maps instead, with the `get_stamenmap()` function. Use the development version of the package; instructions and extensive examples are available on the package's [GitHub page](https://github.com/dkahle/ggmap){target="_blank"}.
