## Choropleth maps

Cloropleth maps use color to indicate the value of a variable within a defined region, generally political boundaries.  The **choroplethr** package makes it simple to draw choropleth maps of [U.S. states, countries, and census tracts, as well as countries of the world](https://arilamstein.com/documentation/choroplethr/reference/){target="_blank"}; **choroplethrZip** provides data for [zip code level choropleths](https://arilamstein.com/creating-zip-code-choropleths-choroplethrzip/){target="_blank"}; **choroplethrAdmin1** draws choropleths for administrative regions of [world countries](https://rdrr.io/cran/choroplethrAdmin1/man/get_admin1_countries.html){target="_blank"}.

Note: You must install also install **choroplethrMaps** for **choroplethr** to work.  In addition, **choroplethr** requires a number of other dependencies which should be installed automatically, but if they aren't, you can manually install the missing packages that you are notified about when you call `library(choroplethr)`: **maptools**, and **rgdal**, **sp**.


We'll use the `state.x77` dataset for this example:

```{r, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(choroplethr)

# data frame must contain "region" and "value" columns

df_illiteracy <- state.x77 %>% as.data.frame() %>% 
  rownames_to_column("state") %>% 
  transmute(region = tolower(`state`), value = Illiteracy)

state_choropleth(df_illiteracy,
                 title = "State Illiteracy Rates, 1977",
                 legend = "Percent Illiterate")
```

**Note**: the `choroplethr` "free course" that you may come across arrives one lesson at a time by email over an extended period so not the best option unless you have a few weeks to spare.

## Square bins

Packages such as `statebins` create choropleth style maps with equal size regions that roughly represent the location of the region, but not the size or shape.

**Important**:  Don't install `statebins` from CRAN; use the [dev version](https://github.com/hrbrmstr/statebins){target="_blank"} -- it contains many improvements, which are detailed in ["Statebins Reimagined"](https://rud.is/b/2017/11/18/statebins-reimagined/#comment-19346){target="_blank"}.

```{r}
# devtools::install_github("hrbrmstr/statebins")
library(statebins)
df_illit <- state.x77 %>% as.data.frame() %>% 
  rownames_to_column("state") %>% 
  select(state, Illiteracy)

# Note: direction = 1 switches the order of the fill scale 
# so darker shades represent higher illiteracy rates
# (The default is -1).

statebins(df_illit, value_col="Illiteracy",
          name = "%", direction = 1) +
  ggtitle("State Illiteracy Rates, 1977") +
  theme_statebins()
```
